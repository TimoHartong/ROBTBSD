 * semantics -- we don't want to require that the caller release the result
 * of prop_object_iterator_next().
 *
 * We'd like to have some small'ish keysym objects for up-to-16 characters
 * in a key, some for up-to-32 characters in a key, and then a final bucket
 * for up-to-128 characters in a key (not including NUL).  Keys longer than
 * 128 characters are not allowed.
